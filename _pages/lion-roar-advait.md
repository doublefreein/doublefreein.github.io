*Building in Harmony with Mother Earth*

## Project Overview

The Lion-Roar of Advait embodies a Mother Earth conscious approach to
construction - honoring the wisdom of traditional building practices while
creating structures that breathe with the land.

This project demonstrates how we can build homes that are not just *on* the
earth, but *of* the earth, creating a harmonious relationship between human
habitation and natural systems.

Located in Gorhe Khurd, Pune, this project serves as a living example of
regenerative architecture that gives back to Mother Earth more than it takes.

## Mother Earth Conscious Construction

Our building philosophy is rooted in reverence for Mother Earth and the understanding that every construction decision impacts the delicate balance of natural systems:

- **Respectful Material Sourcing**: We use only materials that can be sustainably harvested without depleting natural resources
- **Zero Waste Construction**: Every element is designed to return to the earth naturally at the end of its lifecycle
- **Regenerative Design**: Our structures actively contribute to soil health and local ecosystem restoration
- **Sacred Geometry**: Incorporating traditional principles of harmony and proportion that reflect natural patterns
- **Community Stewardship**: Building practices that strengthen local communities and preserve traditional knowledge

### About the name

The name "Lion-Roar of Advait" draws inspiration from Swami Vivekananda's vision of bringing ancient wisdom into modern practice:


```
Shankara left this Advaita philosophy in the hills and forests,
while I have come to bring it out of those places and scatter it
broadcast before the workaday world and society.

The lion-roar of Advait must respond in every hearth and home,
in meadow and groves, over hills and plains.

Come all of you to my assistance and set yourselves to work.

--- Swami Vivekananda
```
